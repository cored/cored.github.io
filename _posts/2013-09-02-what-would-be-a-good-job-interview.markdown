Recently I’ve been having a lot of interviews for employers because I’m on
a search of a new job some of them quite good but others not quite. That’s why
I start to think in what are the things that I like about an interview process
and what I dislike. In that process I came with an idea for employees to test
the skills of a new hire and also to show the candidate some of the culture of
the company. It’s simple kill the Batman… in fact is simpler than that it’s
just to point the candidate to do some OSS contributions to a OSS project of
the company. 

Why is this a good method? Well I love OSS and would love to be part of the
company which embrace this also from the company perspective they will notice
a lot of things from the new hire. They will find out if him/her knows how to
read code and understand it, how to tackle bugs if any, how to enhance a piece
of code and also will notice if he/her cares about quality code. All of this
things are very important for me and I try to apply to companies that also
cares about all of this. I would love to keep getting this kind of interview
instead of the more traditional one which ask you how to write a Binary Sort in
a white board.
