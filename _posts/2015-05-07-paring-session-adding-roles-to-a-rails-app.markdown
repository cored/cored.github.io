title: "Paring Session: Adding roles to a Rails app"

The other day I decided to start doing something that [Avdi Grimm](https://twitter.com/avdi)
is been doing for a long time now; pairing. I'm not doing it as a business
thought just as a way for me to solidify my own knowledge and learn new things
with interested people.

In my first session I did learn quite a few thing; but most of all I learned
about my own way of understanding problems and explaining them to others. My
pairing partner for this session have an application in which he wanted to add
a role mechanism for managing administrator users and normal users; yes I know
a lot of seasoned Rails developers would say "That's easy man" and I agree but
having the patience to explain the issue is another totally different
challenge and even when I already did this in the past I learned some new
library that I will check out like: [minitest-rails-capybara](https://github.com/blowmage/minitest-rails-capybara)

This was a great experience and I will totally try to do it again; some of the
things that I need to take into account is to coordinate the problem to work on
before the actual session and also beware of different development
environments. I'll see what next week brings with this new experiments.
