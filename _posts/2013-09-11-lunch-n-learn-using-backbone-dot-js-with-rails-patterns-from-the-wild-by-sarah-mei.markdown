I've learning Javascript and it's almost a no brainer to start checking
Javascript frameworks in this ocasion I started to check out [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/).
Tha's why I decided for this **Lunch-n-Learn** session to watch a video about
it. I still need to do an small side project to test it for sure.

## What I've learned?

* Backbone is not an MVC framework for Javascript
  * Models
  * Templates
  * Views
* It's use to organize your Javascript
* Page Objects
  * Related functions that do a particular thing inside the view 
  * It's easier to test 
* Model mirroing    (Collections & Models)
* Views that handle events (Views)
* Which can render DOM (Templates)
* Patterns: Greenfield apps
  * Rails === API (No server side rendering of the HTML)
  * Backbone works fine for new greenfield projects but always consider alternatives
    * Ember.js
    * Angular.js
* Backbone sweet spot is when you are converting an existing Rails app to have more client side behavior. 

## Conclusion

Parting from the fact that Javascript is getting more use recently I think is
a good idea to check out this type of frameworks, apart from learning how to
use them with your existing stack I think is good to know when to use it to
solve some particular problems. This video give some advice on the later.
