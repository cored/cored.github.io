Most people that know me knows that I'm a vim user, I really love my editor but
sometimes when I ask why I love it, I can't articulate why because most of the
good stuffs about it are just part of my muscle memory which I have to think
very hard to explain at the moment I just can do.

The other day a friend of mine saw me some normal stuffs that I do with the
editor and he ask me "Please, tell me how I can learn it"; I found this
particular person very smart and I know that he can grabs vim quite fast but
after asking him a couple of questions regarding the way he was learning the
editor he told me the following:

  * I don't know where to start
  * I try to use it but after 2 hours I just give up because I need to get
    things done.

With this post I will try to suggest a one month plan to learn vim for real; 
of course follow this steps on your own time and not if you need to
do something else; aka Don't start learning a new editor at your job.

## Week 1
  * Do vimtutor two times everyday - Well this probably is a no
    brainer but people tend to do the vimtutor just one time and then forget to
    practice what they learn, my suggestion is to just do it for a week 2 times
    a day and at the end of the week at least you will move yourself around
    very easily.

## Week 2
  * Switch editors - At this point you should be able to switch the
    current editor that you were using and move yourself to vim.

## Week 3
  * Find a vim mentor - He/she doesn't have to be a master on the
    editor it just have to be using it at least for more than 6 months; ask
    him/her questions and learn.

## Week 4
  * Print this [cheatsheet](http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif) and 
    put it near you all the time.

That's it, this is a very basic plan which I think could work for a beginner
with the editor. If you think there's something different that a newbie should
know this includes me, share it please, I'm eager to learn more about this
fascinating editor.
