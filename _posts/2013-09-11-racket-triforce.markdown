This is another [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/) post; one a little bit short,
just because this was one of my playing around code that I found interesting.
In fact I was trying to learn how to do a [Fractal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)
with Racket but my limited knowledge about that and about the language throw me
to a different experiment. Bellow the code for it:

{% gist 6523187 %}

This should be very self explanatory. What I like about this code is the
concise that is about showing the intent of the code. Racket keeps surprising
me ;-)
