I don't need to become an expert just expose myself to new ideas. But one of the issues 
of learning something new when there are so many options is to know which
option to pick. 

So I decided to make an effort on finding out; the lazy approach would be to
just ask the web about it. And of course the web has a lot of different
opinions parting from [learning software design](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/pick-programming-language-learn-today-get-great-job-2-years/)
instead of a programming language to picking up the most [popular](http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html) if you
don't know it already. 

I think my approach is based on a mix of both; I would like to learn something 
pragmatic and also I would that thing teach me new skills in an holistic way. 
So my approach would be based on identifying what is lacking on my knowledge as a 
programmer and parting from there I would have a better understanding of my own needs. 
The downside on this is that I really don't know what I don't know. 
That's why I just decide to start reading one book with different ideas in 
it - [Seven languages in seven weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks).
