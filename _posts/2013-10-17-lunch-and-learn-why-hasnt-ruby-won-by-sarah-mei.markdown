## What did resonate with me?

This was one of those talk that I can't say a lot of it just because it's says
it all. The time has come that we should stop thinking about ourselves as Ruby
or Rails developers we should start thinking about ourselves as problem
solvers. Ruby can become a niche language in the end but who cares? There's
a lot of new languages to keep hacking because in the end I'm passionate about
programming in general and not in programming with Ruby in particular. So let's
keep hacking...
