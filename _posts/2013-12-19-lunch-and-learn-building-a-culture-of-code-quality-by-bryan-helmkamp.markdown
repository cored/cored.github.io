## What do I think about this talk?

Well, I was searching for more inspiration regarding leveling up as a developer
and as a part of the team, taking in count that I'm working with more people;
Bryan hit the nail with all this tips in particular the one about the boy scout
rule which I already knew from the Clean Code book but sometimes I tend to
forget to follow. I will try to talk with my team mates about this and see what
happen hopefully all of us can just get better at what we do to get more
satisfaction at work ;-)
