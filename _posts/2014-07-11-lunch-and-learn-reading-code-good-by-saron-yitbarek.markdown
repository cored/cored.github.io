* Try what you are reading to know how exactly it works and validates your
  assumptions
* Research on topics that you don't know 
* Learning happens in figuring out what you don't know and learn it 
* Finding 'exemplary' code is hard; just pick any code base and try to figure
  out the following: 
  * What's the intent?
  * Why was this written this way?
  * How can I rewrite it?

## What do I think about the talk?

Sometimes small and focus topics are the ones that change the way you think
about things; this was one talk that make me realize a lot of things about
myself and my craft. 

For starters I've been struggling on how to read code for
a long time and this is a very comprehensive guide to do such thing. Even
when the author is suggesting on doing it with a group I will try to do it
alone and make a blog post about my findings; yes I know that I did the same
promise to myself with the "A Kata a Day", which by the way I try to keep doing katas
on a regular basics just on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com) now; without
writing about it. So regarding reading code I'm planning on doing this each
week with summary blog post at the end; will try to read part of the selected code base 
daily so I will be able to read the entire thing by the end of the week. If the
code is pretty big and I can't make it I will just blog about my findings of
the parts I did read. I think this is a very doable endeavor and as one of the
suggestions from the talk I have to 'keep at it' to become an expert on my
craft :-)
