Following my daily **improve myself** journey today I found a project from
[Katrina Owen](https://github.com/kytrinyx) with the goal to practice
refactoring. Here is the project [Exos](https://github.com/kytrinyx/exos).

I tried to follow the instructions from the project and my first change was
kinda small but I feel it got better. I hope this entire thing get inside
something like [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) soon, it can be good to have
actual feedback for this.

And without further ado here is the code I changed, first how I found the code
and the following is how the code looks now.


What I did was just to remove the constant magic numbers and put it in it's own
method is a very simple refactor, but I think this is the way to go doing
refactoring in small chunks. I will try to keep improving this code without
using any code smell tool, just to see where my intuition takes me.
