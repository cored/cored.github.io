Here is my list of Clojure resources I've been using to learn the language.

## Books 

* [Clojure Made Simple](http://clojure.jr0cket.co.uk/) I read this book but it
  felt like it should be a series of blog posts.

* [Clojure for The Brave](http://www.braveclojure.com/) This is the one I'm
  currently reading quite fun.

## Practice

* [4Clojure](http://4clojure.com) Probably everybody into Clojure knows about
  this site, I've been doing the problems in there everytime I learn something
  new.

* [Clojure Koans](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans) Another
  great resources for learning the language sytanx.

Well this is what I've been doing, I hope to grabs a lot of Clojure to actually
build something useful ;-)
