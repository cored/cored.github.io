I have some time trying to learn about design. I'm following this course 
[HackDesign](http://hackdesign.org) which is quite good and engaging in my
honest opinion. 

There's a section about types and a documentary about helvetica in particular
which I saw and learn some stuffs from it. 

One of the things that catch my attention was the fact that Helvetica is so use
because it's everywhere. The Apple Macintosh came with it as a default font and
then Windows did the same. The font's history is fascinating from the fact that
it was use in almost any bussiness ad in the 50's to the fact that it's use
when the designer wants to communicate an straightforward and clean message. 

This documentary is worth checking to anybody who is into design and art.
