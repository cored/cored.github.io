Like the last [Lunch-n-Learn](blog/2013/08/30/lunch-and-learn-becoming-a-better-hacker-by-jessica-mckellar) I kept searching for more advice regarding how
to get better as a developer and I found this wonderful keynote from Mark Bates at the [Burlington Ruby Conference](http://burlingtonruby.com/). 

## What I Learned?

* No one wants to be Ringo
  * Being better is archivable    
* Practice
  * Contribute to opensource projects
  * Build your own apps
  * Copy other's peoples apps
  * Build Twitter
  * Build Facebook
  * Write tests for a library (Delete the spec/test directory and start again)
  * Put all in Github
* Github
  * Contribute
  * Put all your libraries 
  * Fix others' people issues
  * Improve documentation of others projects
  * Work in others people constraints 
  * All of this will lead you to build your own style and your name
* Blog
  * Improve your writing and communication skills
  * Write about your projects
  * Dissects other's people projects
* Speak
  * Force you to learn new topics
  * Meet new people
  * Free Beer!
* Networking

There's a lot of stuffs that I can take from this, I've been trying to do most
of them, I've been contributing to OSS for a while now but I would also love to
keep blogging which I started recently and in the near future give a talk;
probably at first I will go to the local ruby user group and try there. 

From the practice point of view I'm enjoying a lot [Exercism](http://exercism.io) and for the
tracking down issues I'm already using [Codetriage](http://codetriage.com) which are two
great projects to help anyone improve their craft. I will try to write more
about dissecting projects which will be a great way to learn more about reading
other's people code and also to learn new techniques in the process. 

In conclusion this was a fun talk which a lot of insightful advices, I totally
recommend it.
