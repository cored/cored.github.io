<p>For a long time I was in the mistaken position of not asking questions in
interviews. After several bad careers decisions I decided that enough was
enough. I needed to learn how to figure out if the company in question was good
so I wrote a questionnaire to ask in interviews. I got some success
just questioning my interviewer about their internal technology stack, what
does he/she thinks about the technology they were using and such and such.</p>

<p>The thing is that we get older and wiser. And now I think the most important
thing that we should try to learn from an interview before signing anything is
how well establish the organization&#39;s processes are. I&#39;m talking about the
things that really matter to deliver actual value to the business.</p>

<p>It is not enough to know that the company is using an &quot;agile methodology&quot; you
should figure out if they are actually committed to the benefits of following
such methodology. You should figure out if the company is actually committed to
delivering well crafted code. Are they doing test driven development?
Are they doing continues improvement to the code through refactoring? If you
can&#39;t figure this out in the interview then you should reconsider if that
company will be a good fit for you.</p>

<p>Probably you are thinking but I need a job right away. And I understand that
but you shouldn&#39;t be putting yourself in a position of suffering; believe me
when I say this if you don&#39;t figure out the amount of effort that you will have to
do to just deliver value to that company you will suffer.  To me life is to short to
be miserable most of the time and since we spend a lot of time at work is better
to find the place that is actually align with our values and goals so we can
smile more often about the things that we love the most, coding.</p>
