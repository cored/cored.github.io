  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Most people that know me knows that I&#39;m a vim user, I really love my editor but
sometimes when I ask why I love it, I can&#39;t articulate why because most of the
good stuffs about it are just part of my muscle memory which I have to think
very hard to explain at the moment I just can do.</p>

<p>The other day a friend of mine saw me some normal stuffs that I do with the
editor and he ask me &quot;Please, tell me how I can learn it&quot;; I found this
particular person very smart and I know that he can grabs vim quite fast but
after asking him a couple of questions regarding the way he was learning the
editor he told me the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t know where to start</li>
<li>I try to use it but after 2 hours I just give up because I need to get
things done.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this post I will try to suggest a one month plan to learn vim for real; 
of course follow this steps on your own time and not if you need to
do something else; aka Don&#39;t start learning a new editor at your job.</p>

<h2>Week 1</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do vimtutor two times everyday - Well this probably is a no
brainer but people tend to do the vimtutor just one time and then forget to
practice what they learn, my suggestion is to just do it for a week 2 times
a day and at the end of the week at least you will move yourself around
very easily.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Week 2</h2>

<ul>
<li>Switch editors - At this point you should be able to switch the
current editor that you were using and move yourself to vim.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Week 3</h2>

<ul>
<li>Find a vim mentor - He/she doesn&#39;t have to be a master on the
editor it just have to be using it at least for more than 6 months; ask
him/her questions and learn.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Week 4</h2>

<ul>
<li>Print this <a href="http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif">cheatsheet</a> and 
put it near you all the time.</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s it, this is a very basic plan which I think could work for a beginner
with the editor. If you think there&#39;s something different that a newbie should
know this includes me, share it please, I&#39;m eager to learn more about this
fascinating editor.</p>
